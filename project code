#Q1 - What variables should be focused on while evaluating credit amount?


#Q2 - How does the scale of purchases affect oneâ€™s credit amount? That is, are individuals more likely to pay off their credit or less likely when purchasing larger items (which may take longer to pay off)?



#Q3 - Given the loan/customer features, we want to predict the default on loans.
